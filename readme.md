 <p> Register Page </p>
 If no admin has been registered but this page allows only 1 admin to be registered.
 You only have to fill in the password input because it only creates 1 admin and I used auto-increments so the ID # you
 will be using when you want to login is "1".
 Note: you can't edit your account in this page because this is intended only for registration of 1 admin.
